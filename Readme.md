### Setup
- clone project
- npm install
- update data object in main.js module based on your data
- run ``` node main.js```

for find lines intersections i made equations for each line in 
```js
a1x + b1y + c1 = 0
a2x + b2y + c2 = 0
```
 format and find the intersection point by solving the values of x and y from the two lines equations:

finally, I checked for points that are 
in the renter range.
